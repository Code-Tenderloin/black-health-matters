  We'll put a happy little bush here. Don't be bashful drop me a line. Without
  washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt
  Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.
  Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Be so very light. Be a gentle
  whisper.

  Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Don't kill
  all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Just let go - and fall
  like a little waterfall. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?
  This is unplanned it really just happens.

  I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and
  squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Very easy to work these to death.
  Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world.
